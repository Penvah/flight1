Hemmed in by jolly Germany and fancy Italy, you’d think the Austrians would be fed-up of their noisy neighbours, but not a chance. For they have secret wonders – 2 staggeringly beautiful cities, a culture that encourages genius (Mozart, Freud, Wittgenstein) and Europe’s most breathtaking Alpine wonderland.

    <h3> 4. The Balearic Islands</h3>
    <p class="text">For the first time in a generation, the Balearics will be free of Club 18-30 revellers.
